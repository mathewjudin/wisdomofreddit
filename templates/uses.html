    <div class="row toppy-20">
      <h3><u>1. Infuse realism into your stories</u></h3>
      <p class="text-justify">
	Wisdom of reddit helps you infuse realism into your stories. For example, may be your character is methodical and you decide to show that by talking about their morning routine. Go ahead, use Wisdom of reddit to research <code><a href="/search?query=morning+routine">morning routines</a></code> of normal folk. Perhaps your want to hint that your hero has troublesome relatives. You can try <code><a href="/search?query=uncle+arrested">uncle arrested</a></code> or <code><a href="/search?query=crazy+aunt">crazy aunt</a></code> and read through the results for inspiration. Or perhaps you want to show your heroine understands technology. Have her articulate nuanced opinions on the latest <code><a href="/search?query=%22self+driving+cars%22">"self driving cars"</a></code> and narrate stories about the <code><a href="/search?query=%22early+internet%22">"early Internet"</a></code>. 
      </p>

    <div class="row toppy-20">
      <h3><u>2. Research professions and places</u></h3>
      <p class="text-justify"> Wisdom of reddit is especially good for researching professions and places.</p>
      <p>
	<ul>
	  <li class="text-justify">Profession search: You can search for professions like this "profession here" E.g.: <code><a href="/search?query=%22surgeon+here%22">"surgeon here"</a></code></li>
	  <li class="text-justify">Place search: Search for places like this "place here" or "grew up in place" E.g.: <code><a href="/search?query=%22londoner+here%22">"londoner here"</a></code>, <code><a href="/search?query=%22grew+up+in+pakistan%22">"grew up in pakistan"</a></code></li>
	</ul>
      </p>
      <p class="text-justify">
	If you are writing about a character living in Moscow you could try a search like <code><a href="/search?query=%22lived+in+moscow%22">"lived in Moscow"</a></code>. May be the comment that complains about the postal service being terrible catches your eye. Voila! You can now use a tidbit of information that only people from Moscow would typically know about. Or perhaps your character works in a large online retailer? You can try <code><a href="/search?query=%22worked+at+amazon%22">"worked at amazon"</a></code> to learn about experiences of people working at Amazon. Here are several variations of searching for professions and places: <code><a href="/search?query=%22worked+as+a+waitress%22">"worked as a waitress"</a></code>, <code><a href="/search?query=%22telemarketer+here%22">"telemarketer here"</a></code>, <code><a href="/search?query=%22as+a+french+citizen%22">"as a french citizen"</a></code>, <code><a href="/search?query=%22grew+up+in+south+africa%22">"grew up in South Africa"</a></code>, <code><a href="/search?query=%22I+work+in+sales%22">"I work in sales"</a></code>,<code><a href="/search?query=%22visited+london%22">"visited london"</a></code>,<code><a href="/search?query=%22mother+is+polish%22">"mother is polish"</a></code>.

      <h3><u>3. A unique writing prompt</u></h3>
      <p class="text-justify">
	Wisdom of reddit provides a rather unique writing prompt - reddit comments that were both appreciated and verbose. I think comments made by others form a fascinating starting point for writing. You do not have to confine your writing effort to a narrowly defined and sometimes unrealistic scenario. Instead you get to work with characters, events and settings that likely happened. To get a random set of comments, simply visit the URL: <a href="/random">https://wisdomofreddit.com/random</a>. Better yet, bookmark the page. Every time you visit it, you will get a new set of randomly chosen comments that you can use as a writing prompt.

      <h3><u>4. Serendipitous stumbling</u></h3>
      <p class="text-justify">
	Stumbling is my favorite feature of Wisdom of reddit. It helps writers discover interesting reddit threads and uncover useful subreddits too! For example, I was looking for <code><a href="/search?query=%22crazy+coincidence%22">"crazy coincidences"</a></code> and a comment that caught my eye was part of the reddit thread <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/q3551/whats_the_most_mathematically_improbable_thing/">What's the most mathematically improbable thing that has ever happened to you?</a>. That thread, in turn, lead me to a comment that helped unblock me. The other time, I was searching for <code><a href="/search?query=%22family+run+business%22">"family run business"</a></code>. One of the search results was in an interesting subreddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport">/r/talesfromtechsupport</a> - which ended up being a treasure trove of relevant posts for me.
