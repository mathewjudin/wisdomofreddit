	<u><h3>Known limitations</h3></u>
	<p class="text-justify">
	  Wisdom of reddit has indexed only a small subset (~0.07%) of all reddit comments. All the 1.2 million comments chosen are at least 150 words long and have scored more than 35 upvotes. The comments span from October, 2007 to September, 2015. So it is possible that a comment you were looking for is not showing up.

	<u><h3>What's cooking</h3></u>
	<p class="text-justify">
	  I am working on the following (in order of priority):
	  <ul>
	    <li class="text-justify">Including relevant threads in the search results</li>
	    <li class="text-justify">Letting search queries be more natural</li>
	    <li class="text-justify">A more creative writing prompt that incorporates images and words</li>
	    <li class="text-justify">Covering all reddit comments - instead of just a sub set</li>
	    <li class="text-justify">Incorporating date and upvotes into the search results</li>
	  </ul>
	  A great way to get me to change my priorities, is to email me at &#109;&#097;&#107;&#064;&#113;&#120;&#102;&#050;.com.
